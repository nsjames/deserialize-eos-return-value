# Deserialize EOS Return Value Example

This repository shows how to use Wharfkit with a contract that returns a value from a transact call
to deserialize the return value.

# Usage

You will need to copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and then fill it with your private key and the account name.

You will also need to go into the code and change the contract information if you want to use this on your own 
contract or network.

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
